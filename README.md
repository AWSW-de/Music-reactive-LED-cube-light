⚠️ Important notes: ⚠️ 

The provided code limits the amount of simultaneously used LEDs, used colours, their intensity and therefor the power usage to fit to a 20W power supply with 5V/4A! Take care of this too when changing the code!
Raising the intensity, used colours or simultaneously used LEDs can easily drain to much power and can end in dangerous usage of the power supply and the connections between the panels and other devices/wires used in this project!
Example: 
Setting all LEDs on 1 matrix panel only to 100% intensity and white color will drain already 3.3A already - on 1 single matrix only!
For the 5 matrix panels used in this project the 100% white setting would try to use 16.5A and would cause to drain more than 4 times the possible amperage of the power supply. This will not end good… Take care… Seriously !!!
All provided vu meters were set to values to take care to not drain more than the 20W out of the power supply. 
Use a good and secure ≥5V/4A power supply to avoid serious damage!
